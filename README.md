***Phill Collins image placeholder***

<p>Similar to other image placeholder sites, this serves the same purpose. Give your page the kind of tender lovin' it deserves. It's only fair, considering he's been waiting for this moment, for all of his life.</p>
<p>you're welcome, internet.</p>


## Usage

### input
<p>In your DOM (or wherever), simply place this url wherever you wish the image to be rendered <br/>
  ```http://www.fillcollins.place/300/300``` <br/>
The key points to note are the sequence of numbers after ".place". Those numbers indicate the output size of the image you want to use, first being the width, followed by the height.</p>
<p>You can also invoke a square image (height equal to width) by using the following<br/>
  ```http://www.fillcollins.place/300``` </p>
<p>In addition to the usual photos, we've also added in a filter to grayscale the embedded image. Simple add a <b>g</b> into the URL like so<br />
  ```http://www.fillcollins.place/g/300``` </p>

### output
  300x300 <br>
  ![Alt text](http://www.fillcollins.place/300/300 "300x300")<br><br>
  300<br>
  ![Alt text](http://www.fillcollins.place/300/ "300")<br><br>
  grayscale 300 <br>
  ![Alt text](http://www.fillcollins.place/g/300 "300")
